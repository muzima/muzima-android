    This guide will take you through setting up OpenMRS instance and working around with some of the key functionality
    within OpenMRS environment.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<strong>Hardware Specifications</strong>

<p> The hardware required depends on the size of your implementation. For small implementations, OpenMRS can be run on
    just about any desktop or laptop.</p>

<strong>Minimum Requirements - 100 patients</strong>

<p>1 GHz processor or better, 256 MB of memory or more, 40 GB hard drive or larger. You can set up the server on a
    laptop for demonstration or testing purposes.</p>

<strong>Minimum Requirements - 10,000 patients</strong>

<p>1.5+ GHz, 2 GB of memory, and 150+ GB of disk space with RAID and appropriate backup facilities.</p>
<strong>Minimum Requirements - 250,000 patients </strong>

<p>4.52+ GHz quad processors, 16 GB of memory, and 500 GB of disk space with RAID and appropriate backup facilities.</p>

<strong>Software Specifications</strong>

<p>Java JDK 1.6</p>

<strong>OpenMRS Standalone</strong>

<p>To run the standalone version, download the ZIP file and decompress it, then double-click the
    openmrs-standalone.jar file to run it. The first time you run this file, it will configure OpenMRS and open your
    browser to the new OpenMRS instance.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>On Windows operating System</strong><br>
    From the command line, you can navigate to the decompressed folder and run the following command: java -jar
    standalone-1.1.jar
</p>

<p><strong>On Linux</strong> Use a command line shell to navigate to the decompressed folder and run the following
    command: ./run-on-linux.sh</p>

<p><strong>Logging In</strong> By default, the initial username and password are as follows:
    * Username: admin * Password: Admin123/test </p>

<div class="padded_div_images">
    <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-login.jpg" width="350" height="200">
</div>
<p>You must immediately change the admin password after installation for security purposes. To change your password,
    click <strong>My Profile</strong> in the upper right of OpenMRS, and choose the <strong>Change Login Info </strong>tab.
    Update your password, then click <strong> Save Options.</strong> You can also change your username, and provide your
    real name, on this screen.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Stopping and Restarting</strong><br>


<p>
    As long as OpenMRS is running, you can return to the application by opening the following URL in your browser. <br>
    http://localhost:8081/openmrs-standalone/
</p>

<p>
    Before you change certain preferences, such as the port on which MySQL or Tomcat runs, you must stop the
    application.
</p>

<p>
    To stop the application, use the <strong>Stop</strong> button in the user interface, or <strong>choose File >
    Quit.</strong> Alternatively, run the JAR file on the command line with a <strong>-stop parameter.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You can restart the GUI by clicking Start, or double-clicking on the JAR file again. Alternatively, you can run
    the JAR file with a -start parameter.
</p>

<p>
    By default, OpenMRS runs the MySQL database on port 3316, and the Tomcat server on port 8081. To use a different
    port, stop the application, then change the port number in the
    <strong>openmrs-standalone-runtime.properties</strong> file or in the GUI, and restart. To override the port
    from the command line, run the JAR file with a <strong>-tomcatport</strong> or <strong>-mysqlport</strong> parameter.
</p>

<p>
    Changing the port number will change the URL used to access the application. To access the application, you can
    choose <strong>File > Launch Browser,</strong> or run the JAR file with a <strong>-browser parameter.</strong>
</p>
</p>

<strong>Accessing OpenMRS in A Network Setup</strong>

<p>If you are accessing an openmrs instance setup in a network, you can access using your preferred browser the Openmrs
    Instance by using the ip address of the particular server or pc where Openmrs is installed e.g
    https://192.168.100.50:8081/openmrs-standalone</p>

<strong>Getting Started with OpenMRS</strong>

<p>After successfully installing an openmrs instance, login with your assigned username and password and click on the Login
    button</p>

<strong>How To Create A New Patient</strong>

<div class="padded_div_images">

</div>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate to Find/Create patient menu on the menu bar and click on it.</li>
    <li>Fill in the information for the new patient in the <strong>create patient section </strong></li>
    <div class="padded_div_images">
        <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-create-patient.jpg" width="350" height="200">
    </div>
    <li>Click on <strong>create person</strong> button</li>
    <li>You will be transitioned to a new page with more form fields</li>
    <li>Fill in all required fields and click on <strong>save</strong> button</li>
</ul>
That's it; you have now successfully created a patient.
</p>

<strong>How to Create A Cohort </strong><br>

<p>
    A cohort is a set of patients with specific characteristics
    *** Locate Cohort Builder on the menu bar and click on it**
</p>

<div class="padded_div_images">
    <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-cohort-builder-select.jpg" width="350" height="200">
</div>

<p>
    *** Click on Patient Attributes Tab**
</p>

<div class="padded_div_images">
    <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-cohort-builder.jpg" width="350" height="200">
</div>

<p>
    *** Specify the parameters the cohort should take by filling the cohort builder form appropriately** Example:
    Gender=Any, Age between 20 and 40, And click on the save button icon as shown below:
</p>

<div class="padded_div_images">
    <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-cohort-save-step-one.jpg" width="350" height="200">
</div>

<p>
    A screen will pop up for you to enter the Name and Description of the cohort you created. Enter the fields with the
    appropriate name and description and click on save button.
</p>

<div class="padded_div_images">
    <img src="../help-content/images/open-mrs-cohort-save-step-two.jpg" width="350" height="200">

<p>
    Check if the cohort was created by clicking on the <strong>Saved link</strong> next to the **Search **text
</p>

<p>
    You are now ready to use mUzima platform.<br>
</p>

<p>For mUzima to work with openMRS you need to have the following modules running:<br>
<ol start="1">
    <li>mUzima Forms module</li>
    <li>mUzima Registration module</li>
    <li>mUzima Processor module</li>
    <li>Reporting Compatibility</li>
