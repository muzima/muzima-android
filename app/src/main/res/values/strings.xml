    <string name="privacy_policy">
mUzima is a mobile application that enables health professionals collect, manage and use healthcare data as an extension to the OpenMRS medical record system. The app is built as an open source end user application, which is provided at no cost, and is intended for use as is. If you\'re using the application for an organization, you\'re agreeing to this Privacy Policy on behalf of that organization. If you\'re using the application to provide services, software and content for someone else, you\'re agreeing to this Privacy Policy on their behalf.
\nIF YOU OR THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT DOES NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE MOBILE APPLICATION.

\n\nThird party services
\nThe application uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. The third party service providers used by the app are:
\nGoogle Play Services: The mUzima mobile application is built to run on the Android Operating system and is primarily distributed via theGoogle playstore. For this reason, your use of the mUzima mobile application is bound by the Google privacy policy with the use of Google services on the Android platform, that is available here:  https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
\nFirebase Crashlytics and analytics: In case of an error in the app, such as the application crashing, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Crashlytics data. This Crashlytics data may include information such as device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our application, as well as the time and date of your use of the application. Other data that could be collected depending on your settings  include location information. The use of the mUzima mobile application is therefore bound by the Firebase privacy policy available here: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.

\n\nCookies
\nCookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device\'s internal memory.

\n\nmUzima app does not use these \"cookies\" explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use \"cookies\" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse the cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

\n\nLocation Data
\nmUzima mobile application comes with optional features that may need access to the precise or approximate location of the device. The features are:
\nRecording patient address:
\nGPS addresses of patients may be stored as part of information stored in the secure OpenMRS medical record system. mUzima provides the ability to set the address of a patient record, so as to update the record in the OpenMRS medical record system.
\nNavigating to the patient’s address:
\nmUzima provides the Geomapping feature to enable the user/provider to get directions (via Google maps app on Android device) to the patient\'s GPS location as indicated by the medical record.

\n\nThe GPS location information collected via the mobile application is purely for the features localized within the implementation and will in no way be shared with mUzima or any third party. The application may use the location information if you grant it the permissions to do so. You can enable or disable location services when you use our application at any time, through your device settings. Your implementation administrator can enable or disable the optional features that need location data via the application settings.
